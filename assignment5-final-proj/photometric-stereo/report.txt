0. basically followed the assignment specs and lecture slides, BUT...

1. When doing surface fitting, I tried to use eigen library but it took forever. Since the M I used was a diagnoal matrix, I'm able to resolve the equations manually instead of using eigen library. It was fast and the results seem not bad.

2. When finding normals for images, results slightly differs when using least square method or not.
